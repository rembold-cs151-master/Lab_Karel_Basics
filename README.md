# Lab 02: Basic Karel
---

The primary focus on of this lab to is just ensure that you have a working version of Python available to you and that Karel programs are running and displaying correctly.

To that end, there are two parts of this lab.
* Ensure that the `TestKarel.py` program runs correctly and that pressing the triangle play button on the window that is displayed moves Karel through the sequence of programmed steps.
* To use the step function in the Karel viewer to walk through a piece of code and then separate portions of the code with useful comments.
